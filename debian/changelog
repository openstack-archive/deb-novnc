novnc (1:0.4+dfsg+1+20131010+gitf68af8af3d-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Adds security patch (Closes: #778618):
    adds_support_for_secure_attribute_on_token_cookie.patch
  * Adds a source.lintian-overrides for include/logo.js. This is a logo, and
    not code source, so I believe it should be fine. Moreover, the file in
    include/logo.js.png is the source, and running "base64 include/logo.js.png"
    generates the same data, so it is my point of view that we're in the case
    of a false positive. If one difers, please provide the patch to generate
    the logo.js out of the logo.js.png file.

novnc (1:0.4+dfsg+1+20131010+gitf68af8af3d-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (well, a more recent commit since upstream isn't
    doing much tagged release...).
  * Kill the wrong patch that landed in the master-dfsg branch somehow, and
    broke novnc (Closes #718889).

novnc (1:0.4+dfsg+1+20130425+git4973b9cc80-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploading to unstable.
  * New upstream release.
  * Added dependency on oslo-config.
  * Updated debian/patches/python-disutils.patch.
  * Removed rebind and websockify from /usr/share/util, since they are
    available in the websockify package.
  * Now depends on libjs-swfobject and use that file instead of the embbeded
    version.
  * Switch novnc from arch: any to arch: all since there's no built binaries
    in the package anymore (those are in websockify).
  * Delete the debian/novnc.init, because the init script is in nova-novncproxy
    already.
  * Ran wrap-and-sort.

novnc (2012.1~e3+dfsg+1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * replace debian/rules build: target with override_dh_auto_build-arch:
    otherwise it is ignored and fails when running dpkg-buildpackage -B

novnc (2012.1~e3+dfsg+1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a build-depend on python-greenlet. There is no actual need for
    python-greenlet at build time. But on some architectures
    python-greenlet is not yet available and novnc should not try to build
    because the resulting package will fail to install. This workaround
    should not be necessary but the maintainer of python-greenlet has not
    resolved portability issues in months at this time and we cannot
    assume it will be resolved quickly. (Closes: #665893).
